                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                <p>In 1977, three friends who studied in the same high school decided to start their own business going through many Ideas. 
                    They worked hard in various fields but failed many times. For their last try they opened  small resort named The Inn, 
                    which later after years was Known as The Imperial Inn which is now after around 60 years the Best Resort in the world. 
                    The friends from school turned business partners where Ms. Aayusha Gyanwali, Ms. Aditi Chapagain and Ms. Niharika Ghimire.
